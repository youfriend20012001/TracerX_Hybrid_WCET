  /// \brief Computation of memory regions the unsatisfiability core depends
  /// upon, which is used to compute the interpolant stored in the table.
  ///
  /// <b>Problem statement</b>
  ///
  /// Memory regions of program states upon which the unsatisfiability
  /// core depends need to be computed. These regions are represented
  /// neither on the path condition nor the unsatisfiability core,
  /// which is just the subset of the path condition. More precisely,
  /// at a particular point \f$p\f$ of the symbolic execution, we have
  /// a program state that can be represented as \f$x_p\f$, which is a
  /// mapping of memory regions (e.g., variables) to their
  /// values. Within the KLEE implementation, constraints on the path
  /// condition always constrain only the initial symbolic values, for
  /// example, the constraint \f$c(f(x_0))\f$, where \f$x_0\f$
  /// represents the initial state, and \f$f\f$ (a function with
  /// program state as its domain and codomain) represents the state
  /// update from the initial state to the point where \f$c\f$ is
  /// introduced via e.g., branch condition. The problem here is how
  /// to relate \f$c(f(x_0))\f$ with \f$x_p\f$ such the constraints
  /// can be used to constrain \f$x_p\f$, which is the state at an
  /// arbitrary point \f$p\f$ in the execution.
  ///
  /// <b>Solution</b>
  ///
  /// When \f$g\f$ is a function with program state as its domain and
  /// codomain represents all the state updates from the initial state
  /// \f$x_0\f$ to the point \f$p\f$, then \f$c(f(x_0))\f$ constrains
  /// \f$x_p\f$ in the following way:
  /// \f[
  /// \exists x_0 ~.~ c(f(x_0)) \wedge x_p = g(x_0)
  /// \f]
  /// This is indeed the specification of an already-visited
  /// intermediate state at stage \f$p\f$ of the execution that can be
  /// used to subsume other states. We could store the whole of
  /// \f$x_p\f$ as an interpolant, however, we would not gain much
  /// subsumptions in this way, as only a subset of \f$x_p\f$ is
  /// relevant for \f$c(f(x_0))\f$. Other components of \f$x_p\f$
  /// would provide extra constraints that fail subsumption.
  ///
  /// Here we note that the function \f$f\f$ can be composed of
  /// functions \f$g\f$ and \f$h\f$ such that \f$f = h \cdot g\f$, and
  /// therefore \f$c(f(x_0))\f$ is equivalent to
  /// \f$c(h(g(x_0)))\f$. Here, only a subset of \f$g\f$ and \f$h\f$
  /// are actually relevant to \f$c\f$. Call these \f$g'\f$ and
  /// \f$h'\f$ respectively, where \f$c(h'(g'(x_0)))\f$ is equivalent
  /// to \f$c(h(g(x_0)))\f$, and therefore is also equivalent to
  /// \f$c(f(x_0))\f$. Now, instead of the above equation, the
  /// following alternative provides a specification that constrains
  /// only a subset \f$x_p'\f$ of \f$x_p\f$:
  /// \f[
  /// \exists x_0 ~.~ c(h'(g'(x_0))) \wedge x_p' = g'(x_0)
  /// \f]
  /// or simply:
  /// \f[
  /// \exists x_0 ~.~ c(f(x_0)) \wedge x_p' = g'(x_0)
  /// \f]
  /// The essence of the dependency computation implemented by this
  /// class is the computation of the <b>domain</b> of \f$h'\f$, which
  /// represents all the mappings relevant to the constraint
  /// \f$c(f(x_0))\f$. For this we build \f$h'\f$ utilizing the flow
  /// dependency relation from stage \f$p\f$ to the point of
  /// introduction of the constraint \f$c(f(x_0))\f$, such that when
  /// \f$c(f(x_0))\f$ is found to be in the core, we know which subset
  /// \f$x_p'\f$ of \f$x_p\f$ that are relevant based on the computed
  /// domain of \f$h'\f$.
  ///
  /// <b>Data types</b>
  ///
  /// In the LLVM language, a <i>state</i> is a mapping of memory
  /// locations to the values stored in them. <i>State update</i> is
  /// the loading of values from the memory locations, their
  /// manipulation, and the subsequent storing of their values into
  /// memory locations. The memory dependency computation to compute
  /// the domain of \f$h'\f$ is based on shadow data structure with
  /// the following main components:
  ///
/// - TxStateValue: LLVM values (i.e., variables) with versioning
  ///   index. This represents the values loaded from memory into LLVM
  ///   temporary variables. They have versioning index, as, different
  ///   from LLVM values themselves which are static entities, a
  ///   (symbolic) execution may go through the same instruction
  ///   multiple times. Hence the value of that instruction has to be
  ///   versioned.
/// - TxStateAddress: A representation of pointers. It is important
  ///   to note that each pointer is associated with memory allocation
  ///   and its displacement (offset) wrt. the base address of the
  ///   allocation.
  ///
  /// The results of the computation is stored in several member
  /// variables as follows, mainly Dependency#concretelyAddressedStore and
  /// Dependency#symbolicallyAddressedStore which represent the components of
  /// the state associated with the owner TxTreeNode object of the Dependency
  /// object. Dependency#concretelyAddressedStore is the part of the state that
  /// are concretely addressed, whereas Dependency#symbolicallyAddressedStore is
  /// the part that is symbolically addressed.
  ///
  /// <b>Notes on pointer flow propagation</b>
  ///
/// A TxStateValue object may represent a pointer value, in which
/// case it is linked to possibly several TxStateAddress objects via
/// TxStateValue#locations member variable. Such TxStateValue
  /// object may be used in memory access operations of LLVM
  /// (<b>load</b> or <b>store</b>). The memory dependency computation
/// propagates such pointer value information in TxStateAddress from
/// one TxStateValue to another such that there is no need to
  /// inefficiently hunt for the pointer value at the point of use of
  /// the pointer. For example, a symbolic execution of LLVM's
  /// <b>getelementptr</b> instruction would create a new
/// TxStateValue representing the return value of the
/// instruction. This new TxStateValue would inherit all members
/// of the TxStateValue#locations variable of the TxStateValue
  /// object representing the pointer argument of the instruction,
  /// with modified offsets according to the offset argument of the
  /// instruction.
