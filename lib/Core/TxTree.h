///
/// TxTree has several public member functions, most importantly, the various
/// versions of
/// the TxTree::execute member function. The TxTree::execute member functions are
/// called mainly from
/// the Executor class. The Executor class is the core symbolic executor of
/// KLEE.
/// Hooks are implemented in the Executor class that calls various polymorphic
/// variants of TxTree::execute. The main functionality of the TxTree::execute
/// themselves is to simply delegate the call to Dependency::execute, which
/// implements the shadow memory dependency computation used in computing the
/// regions of memory that need to be kept as part of the interpolant stored
/// in the subsumption table.
///
/// The member functions TxTree::store and TxTree::subsumptionCheck implement the
/// subsumption checking mechanism. TxTree::store is called from the
/// TxTree::remove
/// member function, which is invoked when the symbolic execution emanating from
/// a certain
/// state has finished and the state is to be removed. The completion of
/// the symbolic execution here is assumed to mean that the interpolants have
/// been
/// completely recorded from all the execution paths emanating from the state.
/// The TxTree::store member functions builds an object of SubsumptionTableEntry
/// and stores
/// it in the subsumption table (member variable TxTree#subsumptionTable).
///
/// To see how everything fits together, first we explain the important parts of
/// KLEE's
/// algorithm, and then we explain the modifications to KLEE's algorithm for
/// abstraction learning.
///
/// Following is the pseudocode of KLEE relevant to our discussion:
///
/// <hr>
/// <pre>
/// 1. Put the initial LLVM instruction into the tree root
/// 2. While there are leaves, do the following:
///    a. Pick a leaf
///    b. Symbolically execute the instruction:
///       i. If it is a branch, test if one of branches unsatisfiable
///          * If it is, execute the instruction without creating tree node
///          * Otherwise, generate the two tree nodes for the branches
///       ii. If it is an error/end point, register the leaf for deletion
///    c. Delete nodes registered for deletion. Recursively, if a
///       parent tree node is found to no longer have any children,
///       delete the parent as well, and recursively its parent
/// </pre>
/// <hr>
///
/// For comparison, following is the pseudocode of Tracer-X KLEE. Please note that to
/// support interpolation, each leaf is now augmented with a path condition.
/// We highlight the added procedures using CAPITAL LETTERS, and we note the member
/// functions involved.
